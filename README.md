## Overview

Building my portfolio HTML wireframe expanded my skills in web development. I learned the basics of Figma design, enhanced my general site planning skills, and had fun experimenting with colors while choosing a color palette. Improving code readability with Semantic HTML was a priority. Additionally, I learned to prioritize accessibility through alt labeling and ARIA attributes. This journey not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of design.

## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- Figma

### What I Learned

#### Figma

Although I have previously worked with Figma designs made by others, this project marked my first attempt at creating my own Figma design. Initially, I didn't have a clear strategy for using Figma; it was a spontaneous decision. I familiarized myself with vector editing, creating elements like menu buttons. Towards the end, I learned to use components for duplicating and reusing parts of my design. Additionally, I began exploring the creation of a design system by working with a color palette.

- Vector Editing
- Components
- Introduction to Design Systems

#### Prioritizing Accessibility

Typically, I didn't consider accessibility until well into my projects. However, I aimed to change this habit. As a rule, I started building my HTML wireframe with the question: "Can this be read by screen readers?" I also put more thought into using Semantic HTML, alt text, and ARIA attributes.

- Semantic HTML
- Alt Text
- ARIA Attributes

### Continued Development

#### Figma

I mostly played around with Figma to build this design. In the future, I plan to take a more structured approach to working with this platform, as I believe a deeper dive would reveal opportunities for a more efficient design process.
